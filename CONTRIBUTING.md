## Before Contributing

Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We take it very seriously, and expect that you will as well.

## New Issues

Before opening a new issue, please consider:

  - Reading [the documentation](./README.md) and [the changelog](./README.md) first.
  - Searching for any related issues and avoid creating duplicated issues.
  - Adding details, diagnoses, screenshots or any type of useful information in existing issues, even if they are marked as closed. The team will still review it.
  - Taking the time to think of a solution and [**open a pull request**](#new-pull-requests) for either improving the documentation, fixing a bug or suggesting a feature.
  - Finally, [**open an issue**](https://github.com/pivotal-gss/kb-docker/issues/new) to report a bug, ask for help or suggest a feature. The more information you give, the better people can help you.


## New Pull Requests

We love pull requests and we are generally very receptive to contributions. Things to keep in mind:

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/pivotal-gss/kb-docker) and make sure to work on a branch up to date with origin master.
- Do your thing!
- Be mindful about doing atomic commits, adding documentation to your changes, not refactoring too much.
- Add tests covering the new code or functionality you are adding.
- Add a descriptive title and add any useful information for the reviewer. If your contribution is a user facing thing, please attach a screenshot and/or screencast (gif preferrably).
- Create your pull request. If it is in relation to an existing issue, please mention it on the title or description.
